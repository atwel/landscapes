I do not think it was any harder in reality.  I just realised I was not complete in describing my strategies.    Initially I payed attention to rounded versus jagged shapes, and that was my strategy first (thinking a bird for example would like rounded shapes).   The first was harder because some of the initial ones were right and some wrong.   But after that in the following sets when it was clear none of the first shapes were correct, I just remembered where those were in the sequence, removed them, and selected one by one the others.  When I got to the third set, I  paused a bit at the start when I was sure of the strategy, to make sure I recalled where the remaining shapes were, and then just chose 2 to start, and added the others one by one.  I ignored the shapes in the second two sets"
